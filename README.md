LCOE, is more efficient because we can use the higher heating value of the fuel, which is the energy released when the fuel is burned. This is the energy that is available to be converted into electricity. The higher heating value is always higher than the lower heating value, which is the energy released when the fuel is burned and the water vapor is condensed.

The lower heating value is the energy released when the fuel is burned and the water vapor is not condensed. The lower heating value is always lower than the higher heating value. The lower heating value is the energy that is available to be converted into electricity, but since our application is combustion, we don't use this value.
